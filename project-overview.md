# Project Overview

The Joule Finance Assistant is an AI-powered platform designed to provide information and support for users of the Joule Finance DeFi protocol on the Aptos blockchain. The platform consists of two main user interfaces:

1. **Joule Finance Chat**: A web-based chat interface where users can ask questions about Joule Finance products, market data, protocol information, and receive real-time assistance.

2. **Twitter Agent**: An automated Twitter bot that responds to user queries, posts market updates, and engages with the Joule Finance community on social media.

Both interfaces are powered by a common backend API that integrates with Claude AI models from Anthropic to deliver accurate, helpful responses based on a structured knowledge base about Joule Finance.
