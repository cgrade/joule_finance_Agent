        "answer": "Main Markets allow assets to be used as collateral together, sharing the same borrowing power pool. Isolated Markets keep collateral separate, meaning each position has its own risk profile and liquidation conditions. Main Markets offer more capital efficiency, while Isolated Markets provide better risk isolation."

        "question": "What is Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)?",

        "question": "How does liquidation work?",
        "answer": "Liquidation occurs when a borrower's health factor falls below 1, meaning their loan-to-value ratio exceeds the allowed threshold. Liquidators can repay part of the loan and receive a discount on the borrower's collateral. To avoid liquidation, borrowers should maintain a safe collateral ratio by either adding more collateral or repaying part of their loan."
